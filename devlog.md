# Pipeline-Sim Development Log

## Project Inception
- **Date**: 2025-06-27
- **Objective**: Create next-generation open-source petroleum pipeline simulation system
- **Initial Setup**: Project structure, build system, core headers

## Session 1: Foundation (2025-06-27)
- Created project structure with core/, python/, plugins/ directories
- Set up CMake build system for C++ core
- Defined basic headers: network, node, pipe, fluid_properties, solver
- Established Python package structure with pybind11
- Created comprehensive README and documentation structure
- Set up git repository with proper .gitignore

### AI Prompts Used:
1. "Create comprehensive petroleum pipeline simulation system architecture"
2. "Design C++ headers for multiphase flow network simulation"
3. "Set up CMake build system with Python bindings"

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement Network class methods
- [ ] Complete FluidProperties calculations
- [ ] Implement Beggs-Brill correlation
- [ ] Create basic steady-state solver
- [ ] Build Python bindings
- [ ] Add unit tests

## Design Decisions:
- **Language**: C++17 for core performance, Python for user interface
- **Build System**: CMake for portability
- **Dependencies**: Eigen for linear algebra, pybind11 for Python bindings
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based for extensibility
- **Testing**: GoogleTest for C++, pytest for Python
